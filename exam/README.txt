Greetings !

Here are some functions of the exam program (Song library) :

- searching using Rest API
- sorting by rank
- setting the chosen songs as default (so when user enters the website one more time the chosen songs are displayed)
- changing the listen later list (adding/deleting/cleaing)
- random song from the displayed
- error handler (not ideal)

Thanks for reading this overview !
